     About me 
 </h4>
<pre>
    I am a final year Computer Science undergrad pursuing my final year project at IIT KGP. The research 
    problem I am currently focusing on is detecting DeepFakes. Deepfakes first gained popularity in 2018 due to the 
    technology being used to defame individuals and organizations. We are trying to detect inconsistencies between frames 
    to detect deepfakes. 

    Previously I worked on detecting attributions in Social Media conversations on the context of the Water Crisis in India. 
    We built a cross attention based model on top of BERT to attribute social media conversations on Water Crisis to the possible 
    causes. The comments were collected from over 600 YouTube videos. The paper is due for submission in IJCAI-PRICAI 2020.
