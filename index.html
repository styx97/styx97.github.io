     About me 
 </h4>
    <pre>
        I am a final year Computer Science undergrad pursuing my final year project at IIT KGP. The research 
        problem I am currently focusing on is detecting DeepFakes. Deepfakes first gained popularity in 2018 due to the 
        technology being used to defame individuals and organizations. We are trying to detect inconsistencies between frames 
        to detect deepfakes. 
        
        Previously I worked on detecting attributions in Social Media conversations on the context of the Water Crisis in India.
